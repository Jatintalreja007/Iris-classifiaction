# Iris-classifiaction
This project is a classic machine learning problem based on the Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in data science. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
